                        <h2>Introduction</h2>
                        <p class="pt-3">Medical doctors and General Practitioners are highly respected by many people for their medical advice and diagnosis of illness. Becoming a doctor and helping people through illness has become a safe career choice for people with skill and nerve for the job. However, due to ever-changing and evolving technology is it possible that someday doctors may be obsolete? A lot of technology has been created in recent years that have made some professions obsolete due to the fact that a machine or some software can do it. Due to internet people now have the ability to get diagnosed by a doctor from their own home without even the need for the doctor to visit.</p>
                        <p>One type disease very common with many people is Heart disease. There are many types of Heart disease and to recover from such requires a lot of exercise and doctor appointments/check-ups.</p><br>
                        <h2>Project Aim</h2>
                        <p>Research and Deliver Home-based rehabilitation system for patients in rehabilitation of cardio-vascular diseases with a user-friendly interface and also a doctor-patient interaction system for doctors to diagnose and examine patients without face-to-face interaction.</p>

                                <h3>Serious Games</h3>
                                <p>Serious games can be thought of as any game based interfaces that has been designed for any purpose other than entertainment. Serious games have been researched in the areas of: military, health, government and education. In this case, Serious Games can be used in the area of health. The Serious games aspect of the may be a solution to motivate patients to continue exercises in an engaging way. Patients are immersed in the game simulation and play the games regularly and as such attribute to their rehabilitation.</p>
                                <p>Lots of research has been conducted in using serious games in terms of rehabilitation. Effective rehabilitation must be early, intensive and repetitive. Serious games provide a means to maintain motivation for people undergoing therapy by means of exercises. Games of virtual reality and imaging of webcam-based games are usually the solution to provide an engaging and motivating tool for physical rehabilitation.</p>

                                <h3>Cardiovascular Diseases</h3>
                                <p>The main area of rehabilitation focused on for this project is rehabilitation of people with cardiovascular diseases. Cardiovascular Disease (or Heart disease) is a class of diseases that involve the heart, the blood vessels (arteries, capillaries, and veins) or both.</p>
                                <p>Patients that require rehabilitation for cardio-vascular diseases must perform consistent exercises as a crucial element in their overall physical and mental rehabilitation. These exercises help the patient in many ways:

<br>- Strengthens your heart

<br>- May improve congestive heart failure symptoms

<br>- Lowers your blood pressure

<br>- Makes you stronger

<br>- Helps you reach (and stay at) a healthy weight

<br>- Helps manage stress

<br>- Boosts your mood and self-esteem

<br>- Improves sleep
</p>

<p>However patients at home tend to either only follow their programmes for a short period of time or do not follow them at all. By using Serious Games with this project, patients may follow their exercise programmes regularly and to view it as a fun activity.</p>

                                <p>Communication between doctor and patient is a key success factor in medical treatment. And as such the doctor–patient relationship is central to the practice of healthcare and is essential for the delivery of high-quality health care in the diagnosis and treatment of disease or rehabilitation. Doctors must maintain a professional rapport with patients, uphold patients’ dignity, and respect their privacy.</p>
                                <p>In terms of online medical systems between doctors and patients, there has been an emergence of websites set up for booking appointments, order repeat prescriptions and view your medical record with certain Doctors/General Practitioners depending on if they choose to use the website.</p>
                                <p>The planned system will be in some ways similar to these online medical systems between doctors and patients except that results taken from patient's exercises will be sent straight to the doctor without the need for direct communication.</p>
